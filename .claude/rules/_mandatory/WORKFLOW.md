## MAIN WORKFLOW

* ALWAYS plan first: 
    1. create session specific plan at `.claude/sessions/${session_id}/current_plan.md`
    2. before trying to jump into exectuion make sure plan approved by user at `.claude/sessions/${session_id}/plan_approved`
* ALWAYS use TDD approach: RED -> GREEN -> BLUE
* ALWAYS use D.R.Y. approach: for architectural awareness, refer to PROJECT_INDEX.json in to root of the project folder
